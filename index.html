                    <p class="lead">This project utilized the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual survey commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This survey asks respondents to answer a broad series of questions assessing their past history, frequency of use, symptoms of use, and preferred brands of a wide variety of substances. The survey also assesses self-reports of physical and mental health, social environment, education, employment, and income, in addition to past experiences with substance use treatment. <br><br> In exploring the data, I wanted to examine several aspects of respondents' substance use over time. These included lifetime use of substances across all respondents, patterns in ages of first use and most recent use of various substances, frequency of use for various substances, and rates of dependence and abuse of substances among individuals reporting use in the last 12 months. <br><br> In addition to these more exploratory analyses, I also developed two models to explore variables significantly related to individuals having received substance abuse treatment in the last year. <br><br> My full analysis can be found  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/msalmon00/Portfolio/blob/master/NSDUH-Substance-Use-Emotional-Distress-Substance-Treatment-Analysis.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

                    <p class="lead">For this analysis, I used the <a target="_blank" href="http://start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Dataset</a>, an open source dataset currently maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. The dataset contains information on over 140,000 recorded terrorist attacks (or suspected terrorist attacks) between 1970 and 2015. However, data from 1993 was lost prior to compilation of the current data set. In analyzing the Global Terrorism Database, I set out to address two research objectives.<br><br>  First, I used Bayesian Inference to examine differences in the average number of fatalities in attacks attributed to the Taliban compared to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (or ISIL). Being two of the most prominent terrorist groups in the world today, gauging the respective human costs of their activities can be one metric by which we can evaluate their respective threat to those living within their spheres of influence. <br><br> Secondly, I examined data on the number of bombing attacks in the years preceding 1993 in order to generate predictions for the number of bombings that might have occurred in that year. I utilized a few different autoregressive models to analyze the temporal aspects of this data when generating my predictions - one examining trends in bombings by country, and the other examining trends in bombings by region. <br><br> My full analysis can be found  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/msalmon00/Portfolio/blob/master/Global-Terrorism-Data-Bayesian-Inference-and-Timeseries-Modeling.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Predicting West Nile Virus Mosquito Presence:</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The purpose of this project was to analyze and predict the presence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in mosquito traps in the Chicago, Illinois region. This project originated as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus">Kaggle competition</a>, with teams being provided several data files from which to draw inferences and make predictions about the presence of WNV. <br><br> A "training" file contained data on mosquito traps around the Chicago area from 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. Training observations described traps containing mosquitos, which included (among other variables) location of the trap, the species of mosquitos detected, the number of mosquitos counted, and whether WNV was detected within the mosquitos detected. Another file provided weather data for the Chicago area from 2007 to 2014, as collected from two separate airport weather stations (O'Hare and Midway), and a final file provided spray data describing times and locations of pesticide spraying in the Chicago area for the years 2011 and 2013. <br><br> In completing the project, teams were asked to predict the presence of WNV for the years 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, given hypothetical information about each trap for specific observational days. That is, provided information about specific trap locations on specific days containing specific species of mosquitos, what is the probability that the trap contains WNV? <br><br>To predict WNV presence in the test set, my team engineered several features in an attempt to capture the probability of WNV appearing based on specific data gathered on the traps and mosquito species observed in the training data, as well as weather data from the time of the test observations. In developing the final model, we decided upon a Bagged Gradient Boosting Classifier, as we felt the bagging process had the potential correct for some inherent error in the singular GBC by creating an ensemble model. <br><br>  The full analysis can be found  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/msalmon00/Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting-West-Nile-Virus-Mosquito-Presence.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

                    <p class="lead">In this project, I practiced collecting data by web scraping the job posting site Indeed.com and then built a binary classifier to predict the salaries of scraped job postings.<br><br>There were three key objectives when analyzing salary information from the examined postings. First, calculate a median salary among all available job postings with salary information. Second, build a classification model to predict whether any job without a listed salary was likely to fall above or below the median salary value. Finally, identify those skills and key terms most associated with jobs above the median salary value.<br><br>I scraped information on nearly 6,400 distinct data science job postings from 17 different cities (e.g., New York, Chicago, Washington DC), however, salary information was available for a limited subset (449) of the job posts surveyed. In the course of examining the data, I employed natural language processing (NLP) to extract the terms and phrases most associated with above-median salaries. <br><br> A logistic regression model developed with eight variables appeared to maximize predictive value while utilizing the fewest number of predictor variables. The model examined eight aspects of each posting when predicting whether salary would be above or below the median value. Examining these eight questions in each job post allowed for above- vs. below-median salary to be correctly predicted in 83% of the test data set. <br><br>My full analysis can be found  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/msalmon00/Portfolio/blob/master/Indeed-Job-Scraper-Analysis-and-Salary-Predictions.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
